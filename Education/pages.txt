The website helps tourists browse, book, and provide feedback on tours. Here’s a simple flow of how someone would use your website:
1. Start at the Homepage

    What happens here?
        This is the starting point for users.
        They’ll see options to search for tours, log in, or register if they don’t have an account.
        They can also access help (e.g., tutorial videos) and privacy terms if they’re curious.

    Next steps for the user:
        Enter a keyword to search for tours.
        Register or log in to access personalized features (e.g., profile, booked tours).
        Click on "View Tours" to explore all available tours.

2. Tours Page

    What happens here?
        The user sees a list of all the tours available.
        Each tour shows basic details (like the destination, price, and duration).
        There’s an option to click on a specific tour to view its detailed information.

    Next steps for the user:
        Browse through tours.
        Click on a specific tour to go to the Tour Details Page.

3. Tour Details Page

    What happens here?
        This page displays everything about the selected tour:
            Location, activities included, price, dates, etc.
            Additional features like photos, tour guide details, or customer reviews.
        There’s a big "Book Tour" button that leads to the booking process.

    Next steps for the user:
        If the tour looks good, click "Book Tour" to proceed.
        If not, go back to the Tours Page to look for something else.

4. Booking Page

    What happens here?
        This page confirms the user’s booking details:
            Tour name, date, price, and any personal information needed (like number of travelers).
        The user enters payment information to finalize the booking.

    Next steps for the user:
        Click "Confirm Booking" or "Pay Now" to complete the booking.
        After payment, they’ll receive a confirmation message (or error if the payment fails).
        They can then proceed to view their booking in the Profile Page or Booked Tours Page.

5. Profile Page

    What happens here?
        The user can view and update their personal details (like name, email, or profile picture).
        They can also see a summary of their booked tours.

    Next steps for the user:
        Update their profile if needed.
        Click on a booked tour to view its details or provide feedback.
        Navigate back to the homepage or book more tours.

        Each booking includes details (tour name, date, status) and links to view specific details or leave feedback.

    Next steps for the user:
        Click on a booking to see more details or leave feedback.

7. Feedback Page

    What happens here?
        After completing a tour, the user can come here to rate their experience and write a review.
        Feedback can include:
            A star rating.
            Comments about the tour or the tour guide.
        Once submitted, this feedback is saved and may be shown to other users browsing tours.

    Next steps for the user:
        Submit feedback.
        Return to their profile or homepage to explore more tours.

    Add Tour: Create a new tour and add it to the website.
    Delete Tour: Remove a tour from the website.
    View Feedback: Monitor feedback submitted by tourists and use it to improve services.

How the Pages Connect

Here’s a simplified flowchart of how a tourist interacts with the pages:

    Homepage → [Search or View Tours] → Tours Page → [Click a Tour] → Tour Details Page → [Book Tour] → Booking Page → [View Confirmation] → Profile Page.

    After booking:
        Profile Page → [View Bookings] → Booked Tours Page → [Provide Feedback] → Feedback Page.

    Admin workflow:
        Admin logs in and accesses:
            Add Tour, Delete Tour, or View Feedback pages.
